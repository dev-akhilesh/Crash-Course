### Assignment 2: Implementing React Router with Nested Routing

**Objective:** Integrate React Router into your application, creating at least three main routes and demonstrating the concept of nested routing within one of these routes.

**Requirements:**

1. **Setup Routes:**
    - Install and setup React Router in your project.
    - Define three main routes in your app: `/`, `/about`, and `/dashboard`. Each route should load a different component: `HomePage`, `AboutPage`, and `DashboardPage`.
2. **Nested Routing in Dashboard:**
    - Inside `DashboardPage`, implement nested routing for at least two sub-routes: `/dashboard/profile` and `/dashboard/settings`, loading `Profile` and `Settings` components respectively.
3. **Navigation Menu:**
    - Create a navigation menu that allows users to navigate between the main routes and the sub-routes under `/dashboard`.

**Focus Points:**

- Demonstrate the ability to configure and use React Router for single-page applications.
- Showcase nested routing by structuring the `DashboardPage` to include sub-routes.
